# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Aside from the README file this repository contains 3 files:

* run_analysis.R
* CodeBook.md
* TidyData.txt

First you need to run the file called run_analysis.R, this file will turn the raw data into a tidy data set.
Then use the CodeBook.md file to understand all the steps that were taken to get to the tidy data set. 
The CodeBook.md file also contains information about the important variables in the tidy data set.
